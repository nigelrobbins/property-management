# Property Purchase Report

To generate a Property Purchase Report, click on the `Add file` dropdown,  select `Upload files` and drag or choose a zip of the legal docs.

The workflow will then automatically unzip the docs, process the pdfs to extract the required information and generate a word document report that can be downloaded.
