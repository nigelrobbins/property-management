# Property Purchase Report

To generate a Property Purchase Report, click on the `input_files` folder and then the `Add file` dropdown, and drag or choose a zip of the legal docs into `input_files` folder, finally click `Commit changes`.

The workflow will then automatically unzip the legal docs, process the pdfs to extract the required information and generate a word document report that can be downloaded.
