A search against the property in the local Land Charges Registers, maintained by the Local Authority was carried out. In the search, the Local Authority were asked numerous questions of a kind normally asked in relation to property transactions.  The purpose was to establish whether there is anything registered against the Property that would adversely affect the Propertyâ€™s value; or if any information held by Local Authority might limit the use to which you intend to put the property.
