A local Authority search was not provided. We therefore cannot comment on any land charges, planning permissions or prohibitions that affect the property. This search is important as it reveals issues that affect the property which you may be liable for such as the lack of building regulations for work which has been done. Should you wish us to conduct a search for you, please do let us know and we will be able to advise further.
