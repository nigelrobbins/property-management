    message_if_identifier_found: "A Local Authority search has been provided. In the search, the Local Authority were asked numerous questions of a kind normally asked in relation to property transactions.  The purpose was to establish whether there is anything registered against the Property that would adversely affect the Property’s value; or if any information held by Local Authority might limit the use to which you intend to put the property. Having gone through the said search, we can confirm that the search has revealed the issues summarised below."
